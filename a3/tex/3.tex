Without loss of generality, let us consider a node whose examples have been sorted by attibute. Then, we consider whether the example has been correctly classified or not.

Then, let us observe a fragment of such a list with \(m + n\) examples where \(m\) corresponds to the number of examples correctly classified and \(n\) corresponds to the number of examples incorrectly classified.

\ldots,0,0,\ldots,0,_j1,1,\ldots,1,_k0,0,\ldots
\end{equation*}
We observe
